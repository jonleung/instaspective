I ordered my usual and we all caught up with each other.\n\n"

text: "It was a very refreshingly brisk afternoon and I could feel the wind gliding against my face as I walked down Sansom. I was walking to the first second semester senior reunion brunch with some of my closest friends here at Penn: The SOFA ACES as we affectionately call ourselves (Salon of Friends Actively Attending Cultural Events & Stuff).\n\n\
When I got there, everyone wasn't there yet giving me an opportunity to do some 1-on-1 catching up!\n\n\
I found out that one of my friends who has been studying Huntsmen + Physics has decided to go for med school! That girl is something else!\n\n\
I also got a chance to catch up with one of my friends that I haven't seen in along time and chat a bit with him and his girlfriend. Because he has been getting so busy with his work and well, his girlfriend, we haven't gotten a chance to see him that often so it was really nice that they could both make it.\n\n\
Then everyone else arrived and we headed inside.\n\n\
As we walk to our table, we are greeted by that kind of elegantly carved furniture that you would expect to have that certain musk. But we only caught wafts of all the other diner's delicious food foreshadowing our meals to come.\n\n\
There were too many good things to choose from on the menu! A couple of friends and I decided to share. We had a terrible deciding between the everything on the menu because it looked so good but we eventually decided on the Buttermilk Pancake Stack, and the Crab and & Egg sandwich!\n\n\
Then our waiter, Scott came over and took our orders. Scott was amazing, he figured out exactly who was sharing with whom and at the end, even split the checks evenly between people who shared! He even put up with our 6 refills of the endless Mimosas (best deal ever, I highly recommend it)!\n\n\
At one point in the conversation, we were all reminiscing about the future and our future Sofa Aces get togethers would look like then. Man I was going to miss these guys. I have been really lucky to be surrounded by some of the nicest most amazing people that I know.\n\n\
Then our food came.\n\n\
It looked so delicious.\n\n\

text: "It was really cold day so I had to wear my puffy jacket that made me look like a purple Penguin. As I walked down Samson, I noticed a stain on my jacket and quickly brushed it off.\n\n\
I had to look nice, I was meeting my friends for brunch at White Dog Cafe.\n\n\
I was one of the first of our friends to arrive at White Dog.. Sweet! I hated people thinking that I was late.\n\n\
I chatted with everyone there for a while and when I found out that one of my friends had decided to go to med school after graduation. \"That\'s cool\" I said. \"I\'m thinking of starting my own company\" I quickly added.\n\n\
One of my friends who\'s been spending a lot of time with his girlfriend was also able to make it! \"I could have a girlfriend if I really wanted to right now too\" I blurted.\n\n\
When we finally sat down at the restaurant, we were looking through the menu and I had a difficult time deciding what to order. I didn\'t want to seem like a douche bag if I ordered the Steak & Egg because it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I didn\'t want to seem poor by just ordering the cheapest. In the end I decided to share the Crab & Egg and the Pancake Stack, those were priced right in the middle.\n\n\
I considered that my healthy vegan friend would judge me for not ordering any vegetables and I grabbed a menu again but decided against it because people would simply think I was eating too much."

text: "It was freezing out and my friends wanted to go get lunch at White Dog? We should have just went to Tap House, it\'s so much closer and the environment is nicer.\n\n\
Not everyone was there so I had to wait in the bitter cold for and wait for the latecommers.\n\n\
I was talking to one of my friends outside who had been studying Physics while also the Huntsman program here and she told us she has just decided to go to med school. I said to her \"Don\'t you think that will be a waste of the skills that you already have? You could do so much more than just being a doctor.\"\n\n\
Another one of my friends was finally able to make it to one of our gatherings with his girlfriend. We hadn\'t seen too much of him as of late as he prioritizes his work and his girlfriend before his friends. Bros before hoes dude. Bros before hoes.\n\n\
Finally everyone made it over to White Dog (if we waited for a moment longer I swear my fingers would have fallen off) and we went inside.\n\n\
I was reminded how dark and old White Dog looked. Wasn\'t really my style. But whatever, we were here for the food right? Nah, their food with this new management wasn\'t that great either. It was all organic and shit but it didn\'t taste that good and it\'s expensive too!\n\n\
Anyway I ordered the one that was the least bad, the Crab and Egg.\n\n\
It took so long for the waiter to get to get my order, man they should have had several waiters just come over at the same time.\n\n\
My friends were talking about what our get togethers in the future will look like. To be honest, we probably won\'t have any more because we are living so far apart from each other. But whatever.\n\n\
The food finally came and yeah, it wasn\'t that good but I wasn\'t expecting it to be anyway.\n\n\
And each time we got a mimosa refill, man it was like had to drag it out from them!\n\n\
Cheap bastards."

text: "I was running over to White Dog for brunch with my friends and I was a little bit late as I was coming directly from another meeting.\n\n\
When I got there, there were still people that weren\'t there yet.\n\n\
Damn it, I had something after this that I couldn\'t be late for.\n\n\
Finally when all my other friends got we were able to finally get in.\n\n\
I quickly glanced through the menu and found the what I thought would be the fastest to make.\n\n\
I didn\'t have the time to wait for the waiter to come back to our room so I walked around the restaurant to try to flag down the waiter and give him my order to put in first, telling him that I was in a rush and if I could get the check for my portion of the meal as soon as possible.\n\n\
I knew that even with that I probably would be late so I sent a text out to my next appointment\n\n\
continue reading...\n\n\
I was walking back to the table and then bumped into a friend I had just met recently. She stopped to chat, I said a quick hello and quickly brushed past her because I didn\'t want to miss my food.\n\n\
I was about to go back and sit down but I realized that I probably should also just call my next appointment.\n\n\
continue reading\n\n\
I finally made my way back to the table and my food was already there.\n\n\
I asked everyone if they minded if I started to eat. Everyone basically just said go for it and I dug in!\n\n\
I said my goodbyes, put my backpack back on, and ran out the door.\n\n\
